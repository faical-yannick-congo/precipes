# Exome Best Practices Pipeline experiment

We have provided a set of execution scripts here supporting the execution of the `exome_best_practices_pipeline.json` recipe. 

Providing a non-trivial sequencing pipeline example is tricky due to the tools, reference files and input files required. Not to mention of the context-sensitive and portability issues related to making analysis tools run in the first place. The scripts here should run in a generic linux environment and the binaries of the required analysis tools have been provided in this directory (+- 120 MB).
